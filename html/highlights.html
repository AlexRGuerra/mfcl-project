It was no otherthan their world class striker Peter Obot who scored on fantastic build-up. Peter took a pass and deftly fired a shot into the bottom corner. This was El-Ettifaq’s first ever Champions League goal and the celebration was epic. Peter said in an interview afterwards, “I put all the demons of Junior Boys Soccer behind me. El-Ettifaq is where my heart is”</p>

Anthony completely obliterated Filip with a meg that left Filip crying on the field. Filip claimed that the sun was in his eyes, the wind was in his face and that he was running uphill during the meg. Nobody accepted Filip’s claim and Filip has been researching new hobbies to pass the time. The list includes: tree shaping, beetle fighting, skipping stones and extreme ironing. In an interview afterwards Filip said, “I’ve been fooling myself for years, I’m not worthy of lacing up the boots and wasting Falzata’s class time. Thanks for the memories. I enter a new chapter of my life. If you will excuse me I have to iron my Poland Jersey and put it away until the 2028 Euros, which may be the next time I wear it”</p>

Both teams, the referee, everyone who lives in the houses across the street and the birds who were minding their own business stood in silence and then broke out into laughter. Faisal didn’t laugh.</p>

Everyone thought the ball was headed to the touchline. Everyone, except for Amadeus. Out of nowhere Amadeus soared into the air like an eagle and headed the ball into the goal for a spectacular goal. In an interview afterwards Amadeus said, “The reason why I have been late for every single class since the start of the semester is because I have been working on my vertical. I perform 568 squats every morning, along with 734 burpees. My calves are like granite.”</p>

Although the goal wasoriginally awarded the Champions League Committee determined that the goal line technology was not working properly (Falzata’s eyes) and thus the goal was rescinded and the game ended in a 0-0 draw.</p>

                    <p>During the second leg, Mr. Try Hard, Mr. Game Seven, Mr. Brexit, Faisal Abuosbeh took the ball, head down, straight ahead and banged home a cracker of a shot from 65 yards out that almost tore the mesh off the net. In an interview Faisal said, “I have been telling people for years that Faisal’s foot is like a cannon, just give Faisal the ball, clear the way and let Faisal shoot the ball. Let Faisal score the goals”. No one knew why Faisal was talking in the third person during the interview.</p>

                    <p>Not really a miss but a huge blunder. In the second leg with Liverpool clinging to a one goal lead and PSG fighting valiantly to tie it up, the ball was crossed into the PSG box. Mr. Crybaby “I don’t want to play for Liverpool, I’m wearing a PSG jacket”, Jayden Plytas, decided to score an own goal, costing his team any chance of a comeback. Serves you right you traitor.</p>

                    <p>During the second leg, Peter Obot decided to take matters into his own hands with a solo effort that was reminiscent of Zlatan’s 2004 Goal for Ajax (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2WsVHbD7zg). Peter Obot has now solidified himself as the front runner for the 2023 Ballon d’Or. Peter said in an interview afterwards, “I went left, they went right, I went right, they went left. I went right, they went left. I went right, they went left. I went right, they went left.” Peter didn’t understand why he ended up near the corner.</p>

                    <p>Sibling rivalry was in full effect during the first leg of this week’s Champions League. Kacper Figlarz who has become the penultimate Meg of the Week Victim was embarrassed by none other than his own brother Filip Figlarz. Although Kacper has been used to being everyone’s meg victim, this meg took it to a new level. In an interview afterwards (interpreted by a translator because Filip wanted to talk in Polish), Flip said, “That guy has been riding my coattails his whole life. Little did he know that during our childhood I was always the favourite. During dinner, I was always given the biggest piece of meat and an extra helping of perogies. At bedtime my mommy would always read me an extra bedtime story while Kacper was stuck playing with his Lewandowski trading cards. Jestem Najlepsza.”</p>

                    <p>During the first leg, Ultimate Villain Kusai scored a goal that has is in the running for goal of the year. Although Kusai was a free transfer, he showed why he is now considered to be top target in the transfer market this January with a highlight reel goal. Ultimate meg victim Kacper Figlarz miskicked the ball (even his teammate Jayden “Mr. Crybaby” Plytas said he did) and crossed it into the goal area. Out of nowhere, Kusai, with all his superhero powers soared into the air, like his hero Cristiano, and headed the ball downwards into the back of the goal. All 14 of the Polish fans, three cows, two chickens and a goat who made it out to watch this 5th division club that no one has heard of, stood in awe. Kusai’s teammates all had to be resuscitated after the goal. After that goal, Kusai missed an easy finish and life was back to normal.</p>

                    <p>It will be difficult to find the right words to describe this week’s Meg of the Week. Billy Imanzi’s reign of megging anyone who came his way ended abruptly, when he became this week’s victim of the meg of the week. Anthony Santo pulled off the most vicious, incredible, jaw-dropping, outrageous, incredulous, preposterous, implausible, improbable meg ever seen. It will go down as the first ever double crossover meg in the history of St. Joseph Soccer Class. Anthony took the ball and violently megged Billy, however, as Billy turned around, Anthony (with a smile on his face) took the ball and megged Billy again. Both teams erupted. Even Billy’s teammates turned on him and congratulated Anthony for humiliating the former King of the Meg. In an interview afterwards Anthony said, “I had it with that guy. His megging days are over.” Billy has officially quit the game of soccer and is now entering roosters into Cockfighting competitions. </p>

                    <p>During the second leg, Nabil Skaff Halaby scored an unbelievable goal. With the aggregate tied 3-3 and the game winding down, it looked like penalty kicks were inevitable. However, on an Al Nassr corner kick Nabil came out of nowhere and soared into the air driving home a bullet header and leading Al Nassr to victory. In an interview afterwards Nabil said, “Look, I know my attendance in this class has been a disaster. Who’s kidding who, it’s downright sinful. Thank goodness I have Falzata who exhibits a patience in me that is above all human understanding. But look what happens when I do decide to show up for class, I score highlight reel goals that embarrass everyone who tries to defend me. Now excuse me while I go to the main floor washroom to hang out for 2 hours with anyone who will talk to me.”</p>
